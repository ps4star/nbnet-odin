# nbnet-odin

An Odin port (not bindings) of nathhB/nbnet, a simple networking library.

# Usage

The actual Odin package is the dir `nbnet/` (called the "package dir" from here on).

Recommended usage is to install (copy) the package dir to `<ODIN>/shared` and use like `import "shared:nbnet"` in your Odin code.

# Progress

Not finished with porting.
